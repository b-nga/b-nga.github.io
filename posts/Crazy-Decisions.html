      <p>"How do you know you're on your path? Because it disappears ... You can't see where you're going. That's how you know."<a class="meta">1</a></p>
      <!-- <p> It's difficult to stay laser focused on one venture, especially in the beginning. After periods of no results or struggle, every other thing seems like a pot of gold. AKA. "Shiny Object Syndrome."</p> -->
      <!-- <p>Most people take a path already paved. Go to school, get a degree, work an unrelated job. It's nice having some certainty that there is something waiting for you. Seeing it at the end of the road.</p>
      <p>However, one of the perks of this entrepreneur thing is there is no paved road to follow. More like a lazy compass that's probably pointing the correct way. It's like, based on your instincts, research, and faith in your abilities, success is inevitable.</p>
      <p>But in the back of your mind, you've internalized the fact that failure is realistic. </p>
      <p>It kind of nibbles on you from the inside while you try to ignore it. In good times you dont feel it, in bad times it's terrible, but it's always there. It sticks with you until you ultimately make it or break. </p>\ -->

      <p>As logical creatures, we all want a path that somewhat garuntees our work will bear fruit. The moment you decide to deviate off that path, people's estimate of your potential drops like a brick. I know for sure when I say "Yeah so I've been coding roblox games for the past year" I see a flicker of pity. People see the platform as some juvenile lego online roleplay thing rather than It's current state as the biggest metaverse platfrom ever.</p>
      <p>But people can't see the value in things beyond the surface.</p>
      <p>It's hard convincing yourself that everyone can't see the potential besides yourself. It's crazy for sure since there's no guarantees that anything You build will be fruitful. But who has done anything extraordinary without a bit of risk anyway?</p>
      <p>You can't see the results of what you create, that's the biggest difference between entrepreneurship and the normal path. It's like Schr√∂dinger's cat: a cat in a box exists dead and alive until observed. Similarly, the result of your work exists in a superposition between "retire your bloodline" and "get kicked out by your parents" and is only realized until the project is shipped. That's why its so "crazy" and "dangerous". </p>
      <p>Either way, nobody I look up to has played it safe. I mean the CEO of FedEx saved his company on a hand of blackjack, and I'm supposed to get rich through index funds.<a class="meta">2</a></p>
      <p>No thanks. üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
      <p>Somethimes it isn't for everyone to understand. If the path you're taking makes you feel insane and invisible, take comfort knowing it's your own.</p>
