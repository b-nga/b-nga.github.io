    <p class="meta">Dealing with the roots of procrastination.</p>
    <main>
      <p>My inspiration for this site came from <a href="https://PaulGraham.com">PaulGraham.com</a> and my friend/mentor <a href="https://Sigilwen.ca">Sigilwen.ca</a>, however, the purpose of these personal essays is for documentation and clarity on problems I've faced. Maybe those in similar situations can also gain from my conclusions. </p>
      <p>One of these problems is procrastination.</p>
      <p>The whole point switching to online school in 2023 was so I could focus on building, but ever since, I've ended up spending more time than I'm proud of in a loop of: </p>
      <p>Bed rotting -> feeling like shit -> Grinding.</p>
      <p>I'm grateful for this experience since I personally got to identify what NOT to do. Just because you've experienced the cycle and gotten through it doesnt make you immune. I learned this the hard way. Growth Isn't just experience, It's an active application of experience.</p>
      <p>So what did I learn?</p>
      <p>Your enviroment/people around you is 70% of your drive. It's why entreprenuers leave their hometown, why they go to good colleges, why they live with 10 roomates, etc. To be around exceptional people. Even 1 friend on the same wavelength makes it exponentially more enjoyable to stay locked in. </p>
      <p>My mistake was waiting for someone, most don't get to start from 0 with friends that want the same. Sometimes you find them at 1 or 2.</p>
      <p>Don't wait.</p>
      <p>Know exactly what needs to be done. Vague tasks like "Build a project that does X" are fine but the issue is when you dont know where you want to start on that project. It leads to overthinking trying to find the most efficient, perfect starting point, but perfect is not the goal. </p>
      <p>The goal is to make something that works, so take inspiration from things that already work.</p>
      <p>So I'm going to go do some research, find what works, and continue building. </p>
