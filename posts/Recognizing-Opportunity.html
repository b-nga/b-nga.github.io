    <main>
      <p>Although my father is dreadfully frugal, he is also a successful businessman, which is why I dont really understand why the only advice I've ever really gotten from him regarding finances was: "believe in yourself", and "invest everything into smp 500". </p>
      <p>Since I didn't get much from him, my knowledge about entreprenuership has come from all the hustles I've tried (door to door sales, dropshipping, graphic design, smma etc. 10+), mentors I've met, and through friends I witnessed find success online.</p>
      <p>It took me a while to sift through all the noise - especially as a kid without guidance & inferior compute - but I soon enough I uncovered the truth I had been searching for: The best way to make money is to build/create where you see there is opportunity.</p>
      <p>And what I saw was Roblox.</p>
      <p>I was already quite familiar with the platform since 2016, and after some research I was confident. The metaverse vision Roblox had was actually reachable, but even before that, devs were making doctor salaries with only a few months of work.</p>
      <p>I knew how to code already, and Roblox's LUAU was simple.</p>
      <p>I could do this.</p>
      <p>So I decided to leave school and hop online so I could focus 100% and distance my mind from people dulled my drive. I learned Roblox LUAU over the next ~10 months making a voxel engine, then I started building real projects. Leading me to now.</p>
